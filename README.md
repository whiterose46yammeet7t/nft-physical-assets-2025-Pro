## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a system like **nft-physical-assets** would integrate with major cryptocurrency exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management.

First, a crucial clarification: The name "nft-physical-assets" is a bit of a misnomer in this context. A platform focused on tokenizing physical assets (like real estate, art, or commodities) would not typically perform high-frequency automated trading on centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance with those specific asset tokens. Instead, the integration is about **managing the liquid cryptocurrency treasury** that the platform holds, which is earned from fees, investments, or operations.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how that integration would work:
